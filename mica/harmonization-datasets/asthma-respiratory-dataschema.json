The DataSchema content provides core respiratory variables that can be used for retrospective or prospective data harmonization. The aim of the DataSchema is to provide a structure to support retrospective harmonization between the BTS severe asthma registry and UBIOPred cohorts, as well as prospective harmonization across new emerging respiratory cohorts.\n\n#### Population Targeted\n\nAdults and children\n\n#### Criteria used in the selection of DataSchema variables\n\n* The variable is relevant to respiratory health research;\n* The variable may potentially be used for a wide range of research;\n* The variable can be obtained in a valid reliable way;\n* The variable is selected if it is of primary interest in its own right or if it effects other respiratory variables through confounding or bias."
